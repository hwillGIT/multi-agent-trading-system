## ðŸ›  Architecture Implementation Details

### Agent Communication Pattern
```python
# Every agent follows this standardized pattern:
class YourAgent(BaseAgent):
    async def execute(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> AgentOutput:
        # 1. Input validation
        self._validate_inputs(inputs)
        
        # 2. Core processing
        results = await self._process_data(inputs)
        
        # 3. Output validation and formatting
        return AgentOutput(
            agent_name=self.name,
            data=results,
            metadata=self._generate_metadata(results)
        )
