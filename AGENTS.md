<general_rules>
When contributing to this repository, please adhere to the following rules:

1.  **Code Quality and Formatting**: Use the provided `Makefile` commands to maintain code quality. Run `make format` to apply `black` and `isort` for consistent code formatting. Run `make lint` to check for linting errors and type inconsistencies using `flake8` and `mypy`.

2.  **Code Reusability**: Before implementing new functionality, always search within the `agents/` and `core/` directories to determine if similar functionality already exists. The `agents/` directory contains individual, specialized agent implementations, while the `core/` directory provides the base framework, shared utilities, and exception classes. Reusing and extending existing components is highly encouraged.
</general_rules>

<repository_structure>
The repository is organized into the following key directories:

-   `agents/`: Contains the source code for individual, specialized agents (e.g., `DataUniverseAgent`, `TechnicalAnalysisAgent`).
-   `core/`: Holds the core application logic, including the `BaseAgent` class, configuration manager, shared utilities, and custom exception classes.
-   `config/`: Stores configuration files for the system, primarily `config.yaml`.
-   `data/`: Used for storing data, such as raw, processed, and feature-engineered datasets.
-   `logs/`: Contains application and audit logs generated by the system.
-   `models/`: Stores trained machine learning models used by the agents.
-   `scripts/`: Includes various helper and utility scripts for tasks like quick-starting the system or running validation checks.
-   `tests/`: Contains the test suite for the project, with unit, integration, and other tests.
