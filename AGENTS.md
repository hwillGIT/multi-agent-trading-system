<general_rules>
When contributing to this repository, please adhere to the following rules:

1.  **Code Quality and Formatting**: Use the provided `Makefile` commands to maintain code quality. Run `make format` to apply `black` and `isort` for consistent code formatting. Run `make lint` to check for linting errors and type inconsistencies using `flake8` and `mypy`.

2.  **Code Reusability**: Before implementing new functionality, always search within the `agents/` and `core/` directories to determine if similar functionality already exists. The `agents/` directory contains individual, specialized agent implementations, while the `core/` directory provides the base framework, shared utilities, and exception classes. Reusing and extending existing components is highly encouraged.
</general_rules>

<repository_structure>
The repository is organized into the following key directories:

-   `agents/`: Contains the source code for individual, specialized agents (e.g., `DataUniverseAgent`, `TechnicalAnalysisAgent`).
-   `core/`: Holds the core application logic, including the `BaseAgent` class, configuration manager, shared utilities, and custom exception classes.
-   `config/`: Stores configuration files for the system, primarily `config.yaml`.
-   `data/`: Used for storing data, such as raw, processed, and feature-engineered datasets.
-   `logs/`: Contains application and audit logs generated by the system.
-   `models/`: Stores trained machine learning models used by the agents.
-   `scripts/`: Includes various helper and utility scripts for tasks like quick-starting the system or running validation checks.
-   `tests/`: Contains the test suite for the project, with unit, integration, and other tests.
</repository_structure>

<dependencies_and_installation>
To set up the project, follow these installation instructions:

-   **Primary Method**: The project's dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
-   **Makefile Convenience**: For a streamlined setup, you can use the `Makefile` targets. `make install` installs the production dependencies, while `make install-dev` installs both production and development dependencies.
-   **Docker Environment**: For a fully containerized setup, the repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` file. You can build and run the environment using the `make docker-up` command, which is ideal for ensuring consistency across different development machines.
</dependencies_and_installation>

<testing_instructions>
The project uses `pytest` as its testing framework. All tests are located in the `tests/` directory.

-   **Running Tests**: You can run the entire test suite by executing `pytest` in the root of the repository. Alternatively, you can use the `Makefile` commands: `make test` to run all tests, and `make test-cov` to run tests with a coverage report.
-   **Testing Philosophy**: Following the guidelines in `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, tests should be comprehensive, covering unit, integration, and edge cases to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.
